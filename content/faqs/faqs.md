# What can I mine with different types of pickaxes?

* Wooden pickaxes can mine basic materials like dirt and stone. 
* Stone pickaxes can mine ores such as iron and coal. 
* Iron pickaxes can mine all ores, including diamonds.


# How do I find diamonds?

Diamonds are typically found deep underground, not too far above bedrock. Explore caves, mineshafts, or dig your own tunnels to search for diamond ore blocks.


# What's the best way to mine for diamonds?

Digging straight down is risky because you might fall into lava or encounter other hazards. Instead, create a staircase or mine shaft and explore different levels to increase your chances of finding diamonds.


# What tools do I need to mine diamonds?

You'll need an iron or diamond pickaxe to mine diamond ore. Using any other tool will not yield diamonds.


# What should I do if I encounter hostile mobs while mining?

Be prepared to defend yourself against hostile mobs like zombies and skeletons. Craft weapons such as swords and bows to fight them off. Additionally, torches can help illuminate dark areas and deter mob spawns.


# What are these meat shanks to the right of my health bar?

Just as those hearts are a measure of your current health, those meat shanks are a measure of your current hunger level. Sprinting and jumping deplete your hunger quickly, while walking conserves it. At a certain point you will be unable to sprint, and you could even starve if your hunger bar depletes all the way! You can refill it by eating food. You can cook various meats dropped by animals, or gather fruits and crops from the environment.
