1. Minecraft can be downloaded by navigating a web browser to https://minecraft.net. 
2. Purchase the game by selecting GET MINECRAFT. This guide is written specifically for Linux/Mac/Windows players using Minecraft: Java Edition, but the general gameplay steps are the same in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. Follow the prompts to sign up for or sign in to a Microsoft account, and pay for the game.
3. You can now download and install the launcher. Follow your system’s process for installing a program, and run the Minecraft Launcher.
3. Select Add account and sign in with the Microsoft account used to purchase the game.
5. Welcome to the Minecraft Launcher! Here, you can modify game options and customize how you want your game to run. For now, we will simply launch the latest version by selecting Play.
6. The game will now download the latest version and launch it! Give it a few minutes or so, and you will soon see the game window appear.
7. Welcome to Minecraft! With the first launch of this version, you will have the option to select accessibility settings, like a narrator, subtitles, and in-game chat visibility settings. You can change these settings later, so adjust them as you like, return to the first menu, and hit Continue.
8. The main menu says hello! Here you can select how you want to play, or adjust game settings. We will just use a Singleplayer world, so select Singleplayer. [main menu screenshot]
9. If you haven’t created any worlds before, you will be put right into the world creator. If you have some existing worlds, just hit New World.
10. For the purposes of this guide, we will not be doing anything fancy. Just type in a World Name, make sure Game Mode: Survival is selected, and click Create New World. After it generates your starting area, known to the pros as “spawn,” you’re in! [spawn area screenshot]
